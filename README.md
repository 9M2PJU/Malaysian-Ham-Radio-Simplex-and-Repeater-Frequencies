# Malaysian Ham Radio Frequencies CSV by 9M2PJU (Including PMR Frequencies)

## Introduction

For amateur radio operators and Personal Mobile Radio (PMR) users in Malaysia, having a well-organized list of frequencies is essential for efficient and legal communication. Whether you're a seasoned operator or a beginner, manually entering these frequencies into your radio can be time-consuming and prone to errors. To make this process easier, 9M2PJU has compiled a comprehensive CSV file containing Malaysian amateur radio simplex frequencies, repeater frequencies, and PMR frequencies.

This CSV file is compatible with CHIRP, a popular open-source software tool for programming a wide range of radios. With CHIRP, users can quickly and accurately program their radios by importing this CSV file, ensuring they are equipped with the correct frequencies and settings for effective operation.

This guide provides clear, step-by-step instructions on how to use the CHIRP software to program your radio with the provided CSV file, making the process straightforward and accessible for all radio enthusiasts.
